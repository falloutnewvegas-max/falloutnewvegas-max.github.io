		<p>Fallout is regarded as a spiritual successor to Wasteland, a 1988 game developed by Interplay Productions. The series' first title, Fallout, was developed by Black Isle Studios and released in 1997. In Vault 13, the Water Chip, a computer component responsible for the Vault's water recycling and pumping machinery, stops working. With only 150 days before water reserves will run dry, the Vault Overseer (Ken Mars) tasks the Vault Dweller with finding a replacement. Armed with the PIP Boy 2000 and Meager equipment, the Vault Dweller leaves Vault 13 for the nearest source of possible help, Vault 15, but finds it abandoned and in ruins.[41] The Vault Dweller then explores the wasteland and locates a replacement chip in the destroyed Vault 12, underneath Necropolis.
